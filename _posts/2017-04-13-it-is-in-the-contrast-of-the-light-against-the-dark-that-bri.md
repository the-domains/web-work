### It is in the contrast of the light against the dark that brings understanding. 

Read more about the amazing NASA composite image above. Here's an excerpt:

> NASA scientists are releasing new global maps of Earth at night, providing the clearest yet composite view of the patterns of human settlement across our planet. This composite image, one of three new full-hemisphere views, provides a view of the Americas at night. The clouds and sun glint --- added here for aesthetic effect --- are derived 
> from MODIS instrument land surface and cloud cover products.
