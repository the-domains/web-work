## The Web is the great equalizer.

The barriers of wealth and health are removed from those who cannot afford school, or do not have the health for it.

This is especially true for those with disabilities.

Equality means different things. Our government was set up to guarantee equal access to opportunities --- not an equal amount of "things".

So, at the heart of my commitment to accessibility is my commitment equal access --- really, to Fairness --- which ensures the ultimate chance to equality.
