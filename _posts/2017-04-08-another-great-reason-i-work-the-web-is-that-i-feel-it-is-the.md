Another reason I work the web, why I am so passionate about it, is that I feel it is the great equalizer.

It can remove the obligation of possessing wealth and health in order to have one's voice heard.

This is especially true for those with disabilities.

Robert is a friend with multiple disabilities. For the prototype CMS we were building, which was meant to be usable on phones, he recommended incorporating a way to automatically send a signal from his device to first responders.

This, of course, meant working with geolocation, which is a powerful technology commonly available on phones. We incorporated a version of it on some test web pages, that were meant to be viewed on phones as well as on desktop computers. I'm hoping we can make this into something that may contribute to his life's earnings. His idea is an important one, I think.
