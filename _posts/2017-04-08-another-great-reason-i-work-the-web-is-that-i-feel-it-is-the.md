## The Web is the great equalizer.

This is especially true for those with disabilities.

Equality means different things. Our government was set up to guarantee equal access to opportunities --- not an equal amount of "things".

So, at the heart of my commitment to accessibility is my commitment equal access --- really, to Fairness --- which ensures the ultimate chance to equality.

### The barriers of wealth and health are removed from those who cannot afford school, or do not have the health for it.
