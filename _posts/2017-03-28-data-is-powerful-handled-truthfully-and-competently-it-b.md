### More than photographs can motivate change.

Data is another powerful force behind change. This is important, because data can cut through the misconceptions and preconceptions we all carry with us. Handled truthfully and competently, data becomes a game-changer. But it needs to be put into a human context to become useful.

That's where data visualization comes in.

When data is presented in visual forms, it becomes human, natively understandable no matter the culture or education of the person looking at it. After all, visual communication is one of the two great forms of communication understood by all people on earth --- the other great communicator, being music.

### Combine data with a personal story to empower it most.

Add a personal story to data, and humanity is added. The power of the data is multiplied exponentially. It's this human context that turns simple information into true human intelligence.
