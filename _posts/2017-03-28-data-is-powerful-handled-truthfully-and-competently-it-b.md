### It's not just photographs that can motivate change. 

Data is another powerful force behind change. This is important, because data can cut through the misconceptions and preconceptions we all carry with us. Handled truthfully and competently, data becomes a game-changer. But it needs to be put into a human context to become useful.

That's where data visualization comes in.

When data is presented in visual forms, it becomes human, natively understandable no matter what the spoken, written, or tactile language is.
